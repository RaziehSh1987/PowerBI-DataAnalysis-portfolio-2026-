# Font:
- If we want to use specific font which is not in the font list:
  - We download the desire font from google
  - Save the current theme of our powerBI project as .json file 
  - Open .json file with note pad
  -Change  font name to desire font name like “b nazanin” font:
<img width="783" height="98" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10c534ef-e939-4b4a-92e6-0dc550261d51" />
  - Upload new theme to our project theme
  - # Note:
    - if the specific theme that we already download the .json file from a website doesn't have  a for example font html code , we must:
      - Upload in our powerBI project
      - Go to Customize theme > Change the font (or other specific setting that we want)  > save as a .json file
      - Now we can change th font or .. to our desire setting
  - We can use this kind of setting for Dark mode

# New Visual in Power BI:
There are different way:
- 1) Get more Visual  ⇒ log in into microsoft  website > and use new visual 
- # Note: It’s better that we don’t use the new visual because:
    - Because the speed will be a little slower
    - Or the work with them is hard
    - Or  some of them may be expired

- 2) Import Visual from a file:
- But we must already download new visual from some website like:
