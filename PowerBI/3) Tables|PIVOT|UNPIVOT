Power query > Transform tab : use to do the change on the column and it is like column tab.


PIVOT:

These 2 table are the same but the row table is better:
 ⇒ column-based table 
Used for reporting. (Pvot)
Converting a column table to a row table is called UNPIVOT.

 ⇒  row-based table (UnPvot)

Converting : 
A column table => to row table is : UNPIVOT
A row table => to  column table is : PIVOT
When we remove or add net item to our data base , column based table is better than row based table because it consume less memory,like:

Ex:

⇒ pivot:


This table show the sales data as a binary data => 1 means, it has the sale and 0 means doesn’t have the data .
Transpose: 

Convert columns to rows
 
after transpose:

Transform > Reverse  Rows: 
Reverse all of the rows.
Format = Transform

Transform > Extract : 
Like extract part of text from each column or cell

One of the most important features of Power Query is⇒ data cleansing.
Transform > Statistics:
Mathematical  formula.

Standard:
Ex: Addition or multiplication or .. in a number


Scientific : 


Transform > Python:
Run Python scripts

Text Analyse:
Run into Azure
home> 

Add Column > index 
Create a column to add a range of numbers


Start at 2 and increase by 2 => 


Merge column:
Select  minimum 2 columns >  select merge Columns >



Custom Column:


Conditional Column:



Columns from example:
To copy from one column of our table and do just some statistical formula. 
Ex: we type Sale  value and then we select the data that we want then we can calculate some formula like 110* 20 then ok


Custom column:


We can write every formula in this part.
Invoke Custom function:
This can get function and do on the column of table

View tab > Data preview part 
We can visualize some information like:

View > query Dependencies : 

Show the relation between tables:

Ex:
