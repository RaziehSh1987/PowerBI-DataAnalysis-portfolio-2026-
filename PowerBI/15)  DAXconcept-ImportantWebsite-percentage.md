# These are 2 important website that we can learn about DAX():
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/
- https://dax.guide/

#  Other important website:
- https://www.sqlbi.com/
- https://okviz.com/our-visuals/ ⇒ we can download different Visual for our Dashboard
- https://dax.do/ ⇒ there is a sample table and virtual environment to code ,run  the DAX codes
- https://www.daxpatterns.com/ ⇒ we can download Dax book / also we can learn the spacial Analysis like Ranking , Basket analysis and ..
- https://www.daxformatter.com/ ⇒ make your DAX code easy to read and give us a good format
- https://bravo.bi/ ⇒ Use Bravo to quickly analyze where your model consumes the most memory and choose which columns to remove to optimize it. You can also use Bravo to export your metadata to VPAX files.

- We can optimize our table with this tool (later we will realize that there is a column that we are not using, so we use this tool to optimize it)

- We write our code in this tools, it clean code and check performance
- Dax ⇒ is a language for make relation with data

# Application of DAX:
- powerBI > select table in Data tab > tools menu:
- <img width="755" height="292" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/169fb1a6-06c2-4b25-8a42-c7266119c5ce" />
- Create Measure (new measure)
  - Output is always ⇒ a number (we can’t have a column as an output)
  - Quick measure ⇒ it’s with wizard (quick)
- Create Column (new column)
  - Output is always ⇒ a Column
- Create Table (New Table)
  - Output is always ⇒ a table

- We have different Category functions:
- Aggregation function:
  - Sum / groupby / join /summerize/..
- Date & Time function
- Filter function
- Logical function
- Math and trig function
- Parent-child functions
- Relationships management functions
- Table manipulation functions
- Text functions

# Note:showing the Percentage 
- When we want show the percentage of the value to total , in our visual:
- Select visual like bar chart > Visualization > x or y-axis >
- <img width="765" height="673" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2dae37e-733b-4f6f-bf98-940a826868ab" />
- Show value as > Percent of grand total:
