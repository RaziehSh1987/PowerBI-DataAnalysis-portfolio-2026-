# Menu:
- HOw we can create menu?
- Insert image > icon(1) like 
- Create a bookmark as “Base Page”  with below Selection setting:
- <img width="892" height="331" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa9d98d5-fcb1-468c-b685-6e30e8993c4f" />


- Create below part on the same position of icon shape like:
Insert > Shape (rectangle) , icon (2) <img width="39" height="56" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b28d2fe7-22ed-4805-9e3a-57187505a3ba" />
 , Slicer (for any filters)

- Create a Filter Page  bookmark with setting up the selection part (just we need to hide last icon(1) )
<img width="809" height="498" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8b2ca6f-0be2-4821-84ed-0494197f7e60" />

- Now we need to specify an Action for both icon to show the Base Page and Filter Page:

- I designed by myself:
- Open Filter Menu
- <img width="855" height="396" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/914251ad-cecd-4200-a394-17c4e490c950" />

# Dark mode:
- If we want to insert a Dark mode button,we have to:
  - Create a button  > In the Action menu > URL> paste a URL
  - <img width="210" height="459" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fa8926e-f5ea-40df-9a82-a0bf5aff18a7" />
  - We must select the url address of another version of our Dashboard that we already designed in dark mode theme with different color base
  - <img width="438" height="679" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41ae63e4-cab6-45c2-a3ff-fe6abc353a8a" />


# Home button:
- To go the the first page  by using the Page Navigation and select the home page(main page) as a Destination

# Note: 
- this is a sample of professional dashboard with lots of icon and professional design:
- <img width="858" height="439" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9ee9266-0616-4a10-852c-07745134a512" />

# Publish Dashboard:
- There are different way to show the result and use the dashboard:
  - 1) Publish into the  Report Server  that contains different dashboard for different company
    - But before that we have to sign up
    - <img width="894" height="351" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79e6fd14-1850-4a12-88bb-9e2e88fff7ee" />
    - Now we can define Permission for View the dashboard to specific user
    - Then User can see the dashboard by log in to this website


  - 2)another way is ⇒ using this address to show into the Mobile phone:
    - The user must install POWER BI app (specific for Mobile) and see this Visual of dashboard with personalize visual. But we have to use below setting to design the dashboard in
      # Mobile Layout mode: 
      - # Note:
        - the user CAN use the normal layout (like before) to see the dashboard in their mobile (but in mobile layout we can design very personalize)
        - <img width="579" height="705" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bccf89f0-5887-4639-9fad-3eabae8abe5e" />
        - Click on Auto-create mobile layout ⇒ to convert the layout into mobile layout
        - <img width="519" height="734" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3dae207f-ef65-4b16-b4d1-571846ab2c50" />


# Sync Slicer: this option is used only for << Slicer >>
<img width="680" height="215" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c09699e1-27de-4329-8deb-d14fbc0aa276" />
- When we want use the same slicer in different pages we must use this optin:
   - Select the desire Slicer:
   - <img width="285" height="246" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f7fe954-0f4e-42f2-be9e-30be0d4b8472" />
   - View menu > synch Slicer
   - <img width="245" height="182" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff44692b-8b89-4d15-b382-09521da6c9fd" />
   - Select the pages that we want show our slicer there
   - <img width="404" height="457" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c400884-6a39-4c5b-89ac-30dcafd04213" />
   - Now, in page 2 we have a copy of << selected slicer >>
   - <img width="435" height="616" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe626759-8130-4e1c-b078-0aa395339d15" />
   - If we want to Sync the selected filter ⇒ we must enable Sync option for each page:
   - <img width="440" height="532" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2f425b2-aa86-4886-9799-4eba9e110e32" />
   - For example in below setting , The selected option is only syncing on page 1 and 2, not syncing on page 3:
   - <img width="321" height="368" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f870444-e2fb-4435-a4c5-eba53096d97a" />
   - # Note: if we copy slicer from one page to another page ⇒ it ask us for syncing or not .
