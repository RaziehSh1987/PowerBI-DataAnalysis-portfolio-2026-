- We have M language in the advance setting:

- Always start with let and finish with in
- The line which are without # ⇒ is the source reader
   - For example this table show the
   - But if we want write a query we have to write code  for example in custom query:

- Source=  ⇒  its the source of the table
- #⇒ when we see the # , it means we want to do something

- All of the lines have , except the last line.
- The last line specifies which line of code is the last code like Added custom1

- 

- # for cleaning the data we can copy all the related  M code from Advance Editor of a clean table  and then Paste into new table
     - What is cleaning data?
         - We have to check:
         - Null data
         - Outlier
         - Duplicate data
         - Data type structure (whole number / text)
         - Split the data into some column
         - <img width="287" height="49" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/538ec48f-dbd1-4819-a31a-c73a67c38c09" />
         - Manage and correct the for example phone number
- ex: clean the database that contain phone number

- # Power Quey is used ⇒ Before coming our data to the System
- # Dax is  used ⇒  After coming our data to the System

# Data source Setting:

- We see the sources that we have read the data  like Oracle,Excel:

- For example from  excel, and if we change the excel file path to another location we can use this option to Change Source path:

- Also we can change the source in this way:
<img width="803" height="412" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/431cd486-cd17-4810-bcb4-494011008764" />

# The application of Data source setting:
- We can just change the source to new data and apply all of the old operation  on new source (it’s important that the number of column and the name of columns are the same)
